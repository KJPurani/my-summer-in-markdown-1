# Summer 2024 -- KJ Purani

## Introduction
My name is Kshitij Purani, but everyone calls me KJ. The reason? I immigrated from India about 1.5 years ago, and I found that my name can be a bit tricky for people to pronounce here. So, for convenience, KJ it is! I'm a rising senior, and I've been enjoying life in the US, learning new subjects, making friends, and diving into some fascinating biomedical research!

## Summer Activities

### **Solo Adventures in India**

This summer has been a whirlwind of amazing experiences. It started with my first solo trip back to India, where I:
- Reunited with family and friends.
- Explored my hometown and relived old memories.
- Enjoyed authentic Indian cuisine that I missed dearly.

### **USC Bovard Scholars Program**

After returning to the US, I had the incredible opportunity to spend three weeks at the **USC Bovard Scholars Program**. This was a prestigious college prep program, but the real highlight was:
- **Meeting new friends** from all over the USA.
- Engaging in **meaningful discussions** and expanding my perspective on various topics.
- Gaining **valuable insights** into college life and preparation.

## Personal Achievements

### **Research Milestones**

This summer, I reached several significant milestones in my research:
- **4 Research Papers Accepted** at various conferences.
- Presented at the **Innovation and Knowledge Conference** in Japan.
- Preparing to present my fourth paper in Arizona.

These achievements feel like major steps forward in my journey towards a career in biomedical research.

## Expectations for This Class

For this AP Computer Science A class, I’m excited to:
- **Deepen my understanding** of computational science, which is crucial in every field, especially biology.
- **Apply new skills** to my research, enhancing the integration of technology in biomedical studies.
- **Earn an A** in the class and perform well on the AP exam.

## Tech Projects and Experiences

### **Graph Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) Project**

This summer, I worked on a fascinating project in collaboration with Cedars-Sinai:

**Key Features:**
- Developed a **GCNN** to predict symptoms in hematoma/hemorrhage patients.
- Integrated **unique patient histories** into the software, allowing for accurate tracking and reporting of symptoms such as:
  - Aphasia
  - Headaches
  - Discoloration

This project has been a significant learning experience and has further fueled my passion for computational biology.

## Volunteer Work and Community Services

### **Hunger Free Hearts - California Branch**

This summer, I founded the California branch of the **Hunger Free Hearts Project**. Here’s what we’ve been up to:

**Activities:**
- Hosting **food drives** outside places like Trader Joe's and Costco.
- **Collecting food** and donating it to those in need across the state.
- Providing **educational sessions** about food insecurity to elementary and middle school students.

In just a few months, our team has grown to over 40 members, and I’m proud of the impact we’re making.

## My Favorite Memory

This summer’s highlight was definitely reuniting with my family in India. The joy of seeing familiar faces after so long, sharing stories, and experiencing the warmth of home again was indescribable. This photo captures a moment from that reunion, and it's a memory I’ll cherish forever.
